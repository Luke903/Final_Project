# Final_Project
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2023

## Theme
Our interpretation of the theme "Inside out" saw us turning the idea of a venture capitalist game on it's head. Instead of exponetially increasing capital, you help make money for a company and then steal it for yourself. Quite literally taking money from inside a company and moving it out to a swiss bank account. 

## Game Play
Objective:
The objective of the game is to reach the targeted steal amount for that day before the timer runs out, the company becomes too sucessful, or the company catches on to your schemes. 

Game-play instructions:
The game functions as a basic clicker, but with a twist. Click the company side button to make money for the company and click the buisnessman side to steal the money away from the companies score. Use the money you have stolen to purchase upgrades to make you better at stealing. In addition to your clicks, the company will also passivly generate more and more revenue as the timer progresses. If the company reaches the target money amount before you do, you lose. To counter act this, the player can click the "Sabotage" button. This button burns an amount of money from the companies score with a slight risk of being caught and losing that increases with each use of the feature. Be the first to reach the target amount so you can retire early! 

## Impediments
Aside from the time limit, there were several problems with group members not being able to access the repository. I personally kept getting an error that said the project wouldn't merge so I couldn't open it. There were also some problems with files getting corrupted and in some cases lost forever. 

## Implementation
Aside from the font pack obtained from adobe fonts, all art assets, sound effects and coded gameplay mechanics are origional

## Future Development
I've had several ideas for future develoupment. The main idea being various levels with increaseing difficulty. The increase in difficulty could come from a tighter time limit, the company starting out with more money, the company gaining passive income faster, and not being able to steal money from the company below a certain threshold (other than 0, which it is at currently). Beyond the levels I could also see some narration in between to flesh out a little bit of a story that explains the character motivation to steal and the difficulty raising between each level.
