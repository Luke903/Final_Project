# Final_Project
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2023

## Theme
Our interpretation of the theme "Inside out" saw us turning the idea of a venture capitalist game on it's head. Instead of exponetially increasing capital, you help make money for a company and then steal it for yourself. Quite literally taking money from inside a company and moving it out to a swiss bank account. 

## Game Play
Objective:
The objective of the game is to reach the targeted steal amount for that day before the timer runs out, the company becomes too sucessful, or the company catches on to your schemes. 

Game-play instructions:
The game functions as a basic clicker, but with a twist. Click the company side button to make money for the company and click the buisnessman side to steal the money away from the companies score. Use the money
